# My son knows how to spell Microsoft

June 20, 2005

There needs to be a traveling businessman’s equivalent of Jeff Foxworthy’s "You might be a redneck" jokes, something like "You are working too much when…"  The first entry ought to be "You are working too much when your 4 year old knows how to spell Microsoft but can’t spell Santa."

I was out of town (getting more and more typical these days), and my wife and kids were at home getting ready to go somewhere.  My son bounds down the stairs, announcing that he has on his Microsoft shirt.  I got him a small shirt from the company store awhile back, and he hasn’t worn it in awhile… but he chose to wear it on a day that I was traveling. 

My wife turned around, startled… "How did you know that is a Microsoft shirt?"

"It says so right here…M-I-C-R-O-S-O-F-T… Microsoft!"  My wife told me that he had this incredibly proud look in his eye.  For a 4-year old that has been working on spelling words like sat, hat, that, ran, so, to, and other short worrds, a 3-syllable word was quite an impressive jump in vocabulary and spelling acumen.

Just for kicks, my wife asks him to spell "Santa."  He coundn’t.  Sigh…

He can also spot the "G" logo for the Georgia Bulldogs a mile away and will burst into "Gooooo BULLDOGS!  Sic ’em!  WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF!"  He is getting pretty good at recognizing the Atlanta Braves as well.
