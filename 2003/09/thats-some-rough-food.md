# That's some rough food

September 4, 2003

My son went to the doctor today for his routine checkup.  We mentioned that he is extremely active (he just turned 3, so "active" is really relative).  He seems to have 2 speeds:  sleep and high gear.  The doctor said he seems normal, but suggested we cut out a series of food items to determine if it might be some kind of checmical reaction.  Cheddar cheese, anything with apple flavoring, anything with orange dye in it.

My wife had to explain to Carson that he could not have a certain food… "it has dye in it."

My son got on the phone tonight to tell me he couldn’t eat something because "there’s diarrhea in it."
